# Lab 1: Python Exercises
## COP-4814 U03 - Fall 2019
Python exercises to introduce you to the language.

1. Write a Python program that finds all numbers that are divisible by 7 but not a multiple of 5 between
2000 and 3201 (included).
2. Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a certain number (input by user).
3. Write a Python program that generates a dictionary with the format i : i ∗ i given a certain integer
number n (input by the user). For instance, if the user inputs 3, then the dictionary should have the
following format: 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9.
4. Write a Python program that asks the user for their name and their age. Then, print out a message
telling them the year that they will turn (or turned) 100 years old.
5. Write a Python program that asks the user for a certain number and then prints out a list of all the
divisors of that number.
6. Write a Python program that given a list (example: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]), makes
a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it. This should be done in one line of code
(using list comprehension).
7. Given 2 lists, a and b, containing integers, not necessarily with the same length, Write a Python
program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists a and
b (without duplicates).
8. Write a Python program to sum all the values (not keys) in a dictionary.
9. Write a Python program that calculates the moment (year, month and day) when someone has lived
for 109
seconds.
10. Given a number n (user input), Write a Python program to determine if n is a prime.
11. Given a string, Write a Python program that: if the length of the string is at least 3, adds ”ing” to its
end. But, if it already ends in ”ing”, adds ”ly” instead. And if the string length is less than 3, leaves
it unchanged. Return the resulting string.
12. Write a Python program to get the ASCII value of a character.
13. Write a Python program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
14. Write a Python program that implement a function that takes as input three variables, and returns
the largest of the three. Do this without using the Python max() function! Hint: Use if statements.
